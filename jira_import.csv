Summary,Issue Type,Priority,Story Points,Epic Name,Sprint,Fix Version,Description
"Remove hardcoded MongoDB credentials from source code",Bug,Critical,2,"Security & Critical Fixes","Sprint 1","v0.1 - Security Baseline","LatestPhasenetLocalTest/phasenet/predict.py (lines 29-32) contains hardcoded MongoDB credentials (root/quakeflow123). Move to environment variables or secrets management. Acceptance: Credentials read from env vars; .env.example documents required vars; .env in .gitignore."
"Fix command injection vulnerability in sampleChunkToMSEED",Bug,Critical,2,"Security & Critical Fixes","Sprint 1","v0.1 - Security Baseline","LatestPhasenetLocalTest/sampleChunkToMSEED.py (line 99) uses os.system() with string concatenation vulnerable to shell injection. Replace with subprocess.run() using list arguments. Acceptance: os.system() replaced; args passed as list; return code checked."
"Fix GaMMa hourly processing bug - wrong variable passed to association()",Bug,Critical,1,"Security & Critical Fixes","Sprint 1","v0.1 - Security Baseline","GaMMaTest/GaMMaTest.py (line 29): when processing >5000 picks hourly the code filters into picks_ but passes unfiltered picks to association(). Change to association(picks_ ...). Acceptance: Verified hourly filtering works correctly."
"Fix event processing loop early break in GaMMa",Bug,High,3,"GaMMa Associator Improvements","Sprint 1","v0.1 - Security Baseline","GaMMaTest/GaMMaTest.py (lines 277-281) has a break statement causing the event loop to exit after the first event. Only first event magnitude/probability extracted. Acceptance: break removed; all events processed; output verified."
"Remove or complete dead code in GaMMa event analysis loop",Task,Medium,2,"GaMMa Associator Improvements","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","GaMMaTest/GaMMaTest.py (lines 246-248) loops through events and filters high-probability picks but never uses the result. Either complete the analysis or remove the dead code."
"Tune GaMMa parameters to reduce over-detection",Story,High,8,"GaMMa Associator Improvements","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","GaMMa currently detects more events than actually exist (overly aggressive). Tune: min_picks_per_eq, dbscan_eps, max_sigma11/22/12 thresholds. Acceptance: Test against known catalog (Ridgecrest); false positive rate documented; optimal params with rationale."
"Create GaMMa parameter configuration file",Task,Medium,3,"GaMMa Associator Improvements","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","Extract hardcoded GaMMa config (GaMMaTest.py lines 96-126) into YAML/JSON. Parameters include degree2km, velocity model, DBSCAN settings. Acceptance: config file created; script reads from file; CLI override for path; defaults documented."
"Investigate and fix amplitude calculation in Latest PhaseNet",Bug,High,8,"PhaseNet Quality & Reliability","Sprint 3","v0.3 - Amplitude Fix","README documents amplitudes are wrong in Latest PhaseNet. Root cause analysis needed - may involve tracing seismological processing (integration, filtering, instrument response). Acceptance: Root cause identified; fix implemented; regression test created."
"Document Earlier PhaseNet reliability issues",Task,Medium,3,"PhaseNet Quality & Reliability","Sprint 3","v0.3 - Amplitude Fix","Earlier PhaseNet noted as having unreliable results but good speed. Document specific failure modes, when/why it fails, and conditions where it may still be useful. Acceptance: Failure modes documented; comparison with Latest PhaseNet; keep/archive/deprecate recommendation."
"Parameterize test dataset selection",Task,Medium,3,"PhaseNet Quality & Reliability","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","Multiple files use commented-out lines to switch datasets (app_RT_ampCalc.py lines 215-219). Replace with argparse or config. Acceptance: CLI-based dataset selection; all existing options available; default specified."
"Make model paths configurable",Task,Medium,2,"PhaseNet Quality & Reliability","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","Model path model/190703-214543 hardcoded in predict.py, app.py, app_RT_ampCalc.py, slide_window.py. Add --model-path argument. Acceptance: CLI arg added; default preserved; path validated at startup."
"Fix all bare exception handlers",Task,Medium,3,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","Multiple bare except: clauses in data_reader.py (194-196, 458), predict.py (41-43), app_RT_ampCalc.py (134-138). Replace with except Exception as e: and log details. Acceptance: All bare excepts fixed; exception details logged."
"Add error handling to main entry points",Task,High,3,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 2","v0.2 - GaMMa Tuned","Main blocks in GaMMaTest.py, app_RT_ampCalc.py, sampleChunkToMSEED.py have no try-except. Any error crashes with no graceful handling. Acceptance: Main blocks wrapped; meaningful error messages; non-zero exit codes."
"Replace print() with Python logging module",Task,Medium,3,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 3","v0.3 - Amplitude Fix","All components use print() for output. Replace with structured logging. Acceptance: All print() replaced with logging.*(); format includes timestamp/level/module; level configurable."
"Add input CSV validation",Task,Medium,3,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 3","v0.3 - Amplitude Fix","No validation of CSV structure, columns, types, or ranges. Bad data propagates silently. Acceptance: Schema validation for picks and stations CSVs; clear error messages; validation at startup."
"Clean up commented-out code",Task,Low,2,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 4","v0.4 - Production Ready","Large blocks of commented-out code in data_reader.py, visulization.py, and others. Remove dead code or add explanatory comments. Acceptance: Dead code removed; intentionally-disabled code explained; git history preserved."
"Fix filename typo: visulization.py to visualization.py",Task,Low,1,"Code Quality & Infrastructure","Sprint 4","v0.4 - Production Ready","LatestPhasenetLocalTest/phasenet/visulization.py is misspelled. Rename and update all imports. Acceptance: File renamed; imports updated; no broken references."
"Create test framework and directory structure",Story,High,3,"Testing & Validation","Sprint 3","v0.4 - Production Ready","No test files exist. Create tests/ directory with pytest configuration and test fixtures for sample seismic data. Acceptance: tests/ created; pytest configured; fixtures for sample data; CI-ready."
"Add unit tests for PhaseNet pick extraction",Story,High,5,"Testing & Validation","Sprint 4","v0.4 - Production Ready","Validate PhaseNet pick extraction against known correct picks from Ridgecrest test data. Acceptance: Tests for Latest and Earlier PhaseNet; known-good picks as fixtures; validate times, phases, probabilities."
"Add unit tests for GaMMa association",Story,High,5,"Testing & Validation","Sprint 4","v0.4 - Production Ready","Validate GaMMa event association against known event catalog. Acceptance: Tests for accuracy and false positive rate; known catalog as fixture; edge case tests."
"Add integration test for full pipeline",Story,Medium,5,"Testing & Validation","Sprint 5","v0.4 - Production Ready","End-to-end: raw data -> PhaseNet picks -> GaMMa association -> event catalog. Acceptance: Full pipeline in test mode; output compared to expected catalog; test data included."
"Create data flow documentation",Task,Medium,3,"Documentation","Sprint 4","v0.4 - Production Ready","Document data flow: raw seismic -> MSEED -> PhaseNet -> picks CSV -> GaMMa -> event catalog. Include input/output formats for each stage. Acceptance: Flow diagram; format specs; example data at each stage."
"Document GaMMa parameter sensitivity",Task,Medium,3,"Documentation","Sprint 3","v0.3 - Amplitude Fix","As part of GaMMa tuning document parameter sensitivity and effects on detection results. Acceptance: Each parameter documented with range/default/effect; recommended values for different use cases."
